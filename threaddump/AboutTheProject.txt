This sample project contains a helper class for obtaining the thread dump of a remote machine, via JMX


basically this is the important line 

ThreadMXBean threadMXBean = ManagementFactory.newPlatformMXBeanProxy(mbsc, 
																 ManagementFactory.THREAD_MXBEAN_NAME, 
																 ThreadMXBean.class);	
																 
																 
import the project in eclipse and run Main.java (define the IP and port correctly )
